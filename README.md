# CUFE CHS Dry Run

This is unofficaial dry run for the CUFE CHS courses registration system. It is a simple web application that allows CUFE CHS students to view the courses timeslots and make their own schedules before the official registration day. It is a students effort to help other students when the official dry run is down which is usually the case.

The data is based on the registration status report that is available on each student portal. The report is usually updated each 15 minutes.
